# Smart Contracts on Test Networks

Welcome to my repository! Here, I display the smart contracts I created and deployed on test networks as part of my blockchain studies.

## Deployed Smart Contracts
Below are the smart contracts I've deployed:

| Contract Name      | Contract Address                              | Network                  | Description               |
|--------------------|----------------------------------------------|-------------------------|---------------------------|
| `FundMe.Sol`      | `0x2c5c45C5a64AA6B820F834A37A37ce2a8C3f26EB` | `SapoliaTestNet`              | Get funds from users, withdraw funds and set a minimum funding value in USD|
| ``                 | ``                                           | ``                      | ``                        |

You can verify these contracts on their respective test networks using a blockchain explorer.
